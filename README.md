# Get2gether

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of our application is to act as a personal secretary that helps the user, plan schedules, organize tasks/reminders, and keep track of their work. The application will use tools such as a chat, a calendar, and a meeting scheduler as well as reminder notifications to help manage their personal schedules. 

1.2 Background

As a team, we struggled to find appropriate meeting times that would cater to each member. This application would be the solution to our problem, because its purpose is to organize both individual and group schedules. Also, as students we tend to procrastinate; however, with this tool, it can help a student keep track of their school work, upcoming exams, work schedules, social  events (i.e. a family memberâ€™s birthday party), and any personal tasks (i.e. Dentist appointments) that they may have.
